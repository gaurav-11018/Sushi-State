# Sushi-State
#### Stars Arena on SUI

## Problem Statement

In the burgeoning sphere of Social Finance (SoFi) applications, two predominant roadblocks significantly hamstring the trajectory towards mainstream adoption and virality:

### 1. Onboarding Quagmire 🚧:
The initial foray into existing SoFi apps often feels like navigating a labyrinth for the average user. The quintessential requirement of mastering blockchain nuances, managing private keys, and setting up crypto wallets, acts as deterrents rather than incentives for new users. This intricacy in onboarding is a stark contradiction to the user-friendly experience that social media platforms conventionally offer.

### 2. Unrewarded Participation 🚫💰:
Current social media platforms operate on a unilateral value extraction model where the platform benefits from user engagement, but the users or creators rarely see a dime for their contributions. This paradigm is far from being equitable or incentivizing for the vast community that powers the social media ecosystem.

## Sushi State’s Groundbreaking Solutions 🛠️
### 1. User-Friendly Onboarding with SUI's zk Login 🎈:
Sushi State heralds a new era of user-centric onboarding by ingeniously integrating SUI’s zk Login technology. With just a simple login through Google accounts, users are smoothly transitioned into the Sushi State ecosystem. Behind the scenes, a non-custodial wallet is created, obviating the need for users to juggle private keys or undergo tedious wallet setups. While many have attempted to implement SUI’s zk Login, Sushi State stands as the only platform with a fully operational implementation, setting a new gold standard in user-friendly onboarding in the SoFi landscape.

### 2. A Financially Incentivized Social Arena 🎉💸:
Sushi State goes beyond the one-dimensional social interactions of traditional platforms by introducing a multi-faceted financial marketplace. Creators are allocated shares for their content, turning their creativity into tradable assets. On the flip side, users can buy, hold, or sell these shares based on a dynamic trading algorithm, akin to the experience on trading platforms like CoinDCX. This disruptive model metamorphoses social engagement into a financially rewarding venture, aligning the interests of creators, traders, and casual users.

### 3. Trading creator's shares with SUI tokens:
Sushi State aims to create value for the users as well as the creators on the platform. The platform lets people buy and trade shares of any user of the same using their non-custodial SUI wallet and transactions in terms of SUI tokens. This will help a very large number of people onboard the network at once.
